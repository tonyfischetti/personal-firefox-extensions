# Personal Firefox extensions

A collection of simple Firefox extensions that I've been working on

- *Remove Annoying Content* - uses content scripts to remove elements of 
websites I'd rather not see like the sidebar in Facebook and the twitter
header in mobile twitter that takes up a lot of space
- *Spanish Translation Utilities* - if you right-click on a selected word
or phrase it offers the option of sending that text to google translate,
SpanishDict, or Lingee for translation. I hope to add functionality to
store the word in local storage so you can make flashcards for them later
